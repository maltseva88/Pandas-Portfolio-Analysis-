## Background
In this assignment, I applied quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas to determine which investment portfolio is performing the best across many areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

# Performance
##  Does any portfolio outperform the S&P 500?
- Algo 1 and BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC outperformed S&P500

- TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC and BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC are risker than S&P 500
